# What's Next?
Web app that keeps you up to date on your favorite tv show episodes!

Deployed on Heroku and available [here](https://evening-beyond-54784.herokuapp.com)

Note: You can search and view TV Shows/Episode information without an account but need to log in to add shows and see when the next episode airs

## Overview
I made this web application because I did not like the available tv tracker apps available in the app store and I wanted to learn how to work with APIs. 

This is a "remake" of a previous website I made that used Java servlets and SQL but did not offer much functionality (searching tv shows, episode info, etc).

All TV Show/Episode information is from the TVDB API. 

Designed so users can easily see all the information, both on desktop and mobile, about what shows they're currently following, when the next episode airs, and what recently aired.

#### Developed with :
- Node.js 
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Javascript
- EJS
- HTML
- CSS (Styled with Semantic UI)

#### Other packages used : 
- Mongoose - for MongoDB
- Passport and Passport-Local Mongoose - for user authentication
- Moment.js - for calculating dates of recent and upcoming episodes
